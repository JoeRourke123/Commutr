## What the frick is going on here?
In this directory, `controller/`, we are keeping all of our API endpoints. These are collated into ViewSets, a concept in the library for creating REST APIs in Django. These ViewSets link closely with the database models and allow for automatic generation of certain API behaviour, but also allow for custom endpoints to be created.
